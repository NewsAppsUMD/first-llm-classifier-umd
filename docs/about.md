# About

This guide was prepared by [Ben Welsh](https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/) and [Derek Willis](https://schedules.ire.org/nicar-2025/index.html#2046) for [a training session](https://schedules.ire.org/nicar-2025/index.html#2045) at the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting’s 2025 conference in Minnapolis. Some of the copy was written with the assistance of GitHub’s Copilot, an AI-powered text generator. The materials are available as free and [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/palewire/first-llm-classifier).
