# The Groq API

_This page will walk through what Groq is and how to get the API key we'll use in class._

In addition to the commercial Large Language Models we're constantly hearing about - ChatGPT, Claude, etc. - there are a number of open models that you can download and run on your computer (if you have the memory and processing capabilities). [Groq](https://groq.com/) - not to be confused with the AI called Grok released by Twitter/X - provides fast API access to those open models, including the one we'll be using for this class.

Here's how to get started with Groq: go to [groq.com](https://groq.com/) and click on the "Dev Console" button on the top right.

Create an account. I logged in with GitHub. You can do whatever you'd like. When you're logged in, click "API keys" on the top right.

Go ahead and create an API key, name it (first-llm-classifer is a good choice) and copy the API key value to your clipboard. For now, paste that API key value into a text file on your computer. We'll need it later.
