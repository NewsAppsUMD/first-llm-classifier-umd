# Getting started with Groq

In addition to the commercial services, like ChatGPT, that draw the most media attention, there are a number of other ways to access large-language models, including free variations that you can download and run directly on your computer.

For this demonstration, we will use an online service called [Groq](https://groq.com/). Not to be confused Elon Musk's Grok, which is a different AI entirely, Groq provides fast, inexpensive API access to a variety of open-source models. It is stable and speedy. Its code is similar to the what's offered by other services, so the skills you learn here should be transferable to other platforms.

To get access to its services, go to [groq.com](https://groq.com/). Click on the "Dev Console" button on the top right.

Create an account. When you're logged in, click "API keys" on the top right.

Go ahead and create an API key, name it. We think `first-llm-classifer` is a good choice. Copy the key to your clipboard. For now, paste that value into a text file on your computer. We'll need it later.
