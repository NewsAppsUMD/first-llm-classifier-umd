# First LLM Classifier

Learn how journalists use large-language models to organize and analyze massive datasets

## What you will learn

Take this three-hour class to get hands-on experience creating a machine-learning model that can classify the text recorded in campaign contributions, crime reports, legislation, consumer complaints and other newsworthy data. An example of this would be categorizing certain kinds of expenditures or assigning a topic to legislative text.

It will teach you how to:

* Replace a complex machine-learning system with a simple LLM system
* Write a prompt that classifies text into predefined categories
* Evaluate your results using a rigorous, scientific approach
* Improve your prompt by training it with rules and examples

By the end, you will understand how the new class of LLM classifiers can outperform traditional machine-learning methods with significantly less code, and you will be ready to write one yourself.

## Who can take it

Anyone who has dabbled with code and AI is qualified for this class. A curious mind and good attitude are all thatâ€™s required, but a familiarity with the Python programming language and a willingness to experiment will certainly come in handy.
