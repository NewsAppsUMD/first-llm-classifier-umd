# Why use an LLM?

#### What is an LLM?

A Large Language Model (LLM) is an AI system trained on huge amounts of text data. It learns to recognize patterns in language, making it capable of answering questions, summarizing documents and even generating human-like text. Unlike traditional models that need carefully labeled training data for each specific task, an LLM can generalize across multiple domains, making it a good tool for classification tasks that require general knowledge.

#### Using LLMs for Classification

LLMs can be used to automatically categorize text, whether it's classifying news articles by topic, sorting customer reviews by sentiment or putting campaign finance expenditures into meaningful categories. Instead of training a model from scratch, you can describe the classification task in specific plain language and let the LLM handle the rest. By crafting clear prompts, you can instruct the model to consistently assign categories.

#### Why LLMs Outperform Traditional Machine Learning

Traditional machine learning classifiers rely on a "supervised" approach, meaning they need a labeled dataset to learn from. While this works well for structured problems, it requires a lot of time and effort to build a high-quality training dataset. LLMs, on the other hand, come pre-trained on a vast corpus of text and can classify data with little to no additional training. They are particularly useful when dealing with edge cases or categories that would require extensive labeled examples in a traditional setup. This makes LLMs an useful solution for text classification in journalism, where time matters and resources can be scarce.
