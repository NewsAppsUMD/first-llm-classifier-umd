# What we'll do

In this class, you'll learn to build a system that can classify text into categories. Instead of manually sifting through spreadsheets or relying on traditional machine learning models that need tons of training data, we'll use a Large Language Model (LLM) to do the heavy lifting. With a few well-crafted prompts and some Python, you can get structured, meaningful responses from the model.

#### Why you should care about this

Journalists frequently deal with messy, unstructured data, whether police reports, campaign finance records or legislative bills. Sorting through that information by hand is slow and painful, but automation can help. LLMs can categorize records, extract key details, and even flag unusual patterns, all in a way that you'll be able to validate, helping reporters focus on finding the story.

#### Our use case: campaign finance expenditures

You'll be working with real-world campaign finance data. Political campaigns spend money on everything from pizza to private jets, and tracking that spending can reveal patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. By classifying expenditures into categories like "Hotels," "Restaurants" or "Consulting Services" we can spot patterns faster, leading to better stories. The campaign finance data comes from the California Civic Data Coalition, which maintains a clean, structured version of the state's CAL-ACCESS filings. This dataset includes detailed records of campaign expenditures, making it a perfect test case for our classification system.
