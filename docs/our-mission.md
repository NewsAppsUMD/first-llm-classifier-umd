# What we'll do

Briefly explain what we're aiming to do in this class

- Create a system for classifying text into categories
- Journalists do this for X, Y, Z
- Our example will be campaign finance expenditures
- Examples of past corruption stories involving spending like George Santos and Fabian Nunez
- Our data source will be the California Civic Data Coalition's extracts from CAL-ACCESS
- The data has been pre-downloaded and prepared this a script we can link to
