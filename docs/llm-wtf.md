# The LLM's advantage

A [large-language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) is an artificial intelligence system trained on vast amounts of text capable of understanding and generating human language. These systems are commonly referred to by the acronym LLM. The most prominent examples include OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude, but there are many others, including several open-source options.

While they are most famous for their ability to converse with humans as chatbots, LLMs can perform a wide range of language processing tasks, including text classification, summarization and translation.

Unlike traditional machine-learning models, LLMs do not require users to provide carefully labeled training data to perform a specific task. Instead, users can be prompted with a broad description of the goal and a few examples of rules and then generate responses that are informed by the massive amount of information they contain. That deep knowledge can be especially beneficial when dealing with a dataset containing widely varying inputs or categories that would require extensive labeled examples in a traditional setup.

LLMs also do not require the user to understand machine-learning concepts, like vectorization or Bayesian statistics, or to write complex code to train and evaluate the model. Instead, users can submit prompts in plain language, which the model will use to generate responses. This makes it easier for journalists to experiment with different approaches and quickly iterate on their work.
